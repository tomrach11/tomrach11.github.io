        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspA bit about myself, I am very chill person. I love to just walk around the city or park and just listen to music, finding good spot to enjoy the scenery or watching people doing there things. I also love all kind of sport. And I really mean it by<strong> all kind of sports. </strong>I want to experience playing every kind of sport. I also enjoy watching almost every sport especially live in stadium or even high school games. At home, on my free time, I love to watch anime even tho I do not have much time lately. There are so many anime shows I still want to catch up. Other than anime, I also love playing video game especially competitive shooting game. I have been playing game since I was a little kid and make so many friend because of it. </p>
